Salt air, and the rust on your door. I never needed anything more. Whispers of "Are you sure?". But I can see us lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time. 'Cause it was never mine. And I can see us twisted in bedsheets. August sipped away like a bottle of wine
Your back beneath the sun. Wishin' I could write my name on it. Will you call when you're back at school?. I remember thinkin' I had you
But I can see us lost in the memory. August slipped away into a moment in time. And I can see us twisted in bedsheets. August sipped away like a bottle of wine
Back when we were still changin' for the better. Wanting was enough. For me, it was enough. To live for the hope of it all
And say, "Meet me behind the mall". So much for summer love and saying "us". 'Cause you weren't mine to lose. You weren't mine to lose, no
But I can see us lost in the memory. August slipped away into a moment in time. 'Cause it was never mine. And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away like a bottle of wine. Remember when I pulled up and said "Get in the car". And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?. Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all, for the hope of it all
"Meet me behind the mall". (Remember when I pulled up and said "Get in the car"). (Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all, for the hope of it all). ("Meet me behind the mall")
Remember when I pulled up and said "Get in the car". And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?. Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all (For the hope of it all). For the hope of it all, for the hope of it all
